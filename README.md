  drawDiagram - Draws a circular diagram with customizable parameters.

  Parameters:
    value:      Value to represent in the diagram (0-100).
    x:          X-coordinate of the diagram's center.
    y:          Y-coordinate of the diagram's center.
    r:          Radius of the diagram.
    lineWidth:  Determines the thickness of the diagram's lines.
    lineColor:  Color of the lines in the diagram.
    bgColor:    Background color of the diagram.

  The function draws a circular diagram using lines to represent the value.
  The thicker the lines (lineWidth), the more saturated the diagram fill appears.
  The diagram is drawn from an initial angle (angleStart) to the value-mapped angle (angleEnd).
  The diagram is drawn step by step with an increment of angleStep.

  After drawing the lines, the function displays the value as text near the center of the diagram.

  Note: Make sure to have the appropriate display library included and configured.
